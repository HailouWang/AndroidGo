    This is an example of an accessibility service that provides custom feedback for the Clock
    application which comes by default with Android devices. It is a hands-on example of various
    ways to utilize the accessibility API for providing alternative and complementary feedback.
    The sample demonstrates how to provide application specific feedback &mdash; the service
    handles only accessibility events from the Clock application. Further, the sample demonstrates
    how to provide dynamic, context-dependent feedback &mdash; feedback type changes depending on
    the ringer mode.

  <dd>Demonstrates how to implement accessibility support of custom views. Custom view
      is a tailored widget developed by extending the base classes in the android.view
      package. This sample shows how to implement the accessibility behavior via both
      inheritance (non backwards compatible) and composition (backwards compatible).
